                    <p class="align-left">When I was little, the first thing I would do after completing my schoolwork was hop on my dads computer and play some videogames like:</p>

                    <ul class="align-left list-style">
                        <li>Tonka Construction</li>
                        <li>Lego Island</li>
                        <li>Baldurs Gate II <em>(okay maybe i'm joking with this one)</em></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="align-left">
                        These games were the beginning of my amazing journey with computers. In high-school, I attended a technical school
                        for media communications. It was at this point I was introduced into the world of web-design. My teacher Kevin kickstarted
                        and pushed me to delve deeper into the programming aspect of things, and this is where I am now. I dabbled with multiple 
                        languages and tools along the way. In order, these were some things I tried:
                    </p>

                    <!--Languages and Tools Nested Lists-->
                    <ol class="inside-list align-left list-style">
                        <!--C# Tools List-->
                        <li>C# with:
                            <ul class="inside-list align-left list-style">
                                <li>Unity Game Engine</li>
                                <li>ASP.NET</li>
                                <li>Visual Studio Development</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <!--C/C++ Tools List-->
                        <li>C/C++ with:
                            
                            <ul class="inside-list align-left list-style">
                                <li>CLion by JetBrains</li>

                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="align-left">
                        Equipped with the knowledge i gained along the way, I plan on diving deep into web-development, and furthering my education down
                        the road by attending West Virginia University (WVU) for Engineering. I want to collaborate with others on both large and small
                        scale projects. As the saying goes, Teamwork Makes The Dream Work! 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p class="align-left"> 
                        Also, If you couldn't tell from above, I enjoy my fair bit of gaming.
                        Game-Development is a huge interest for me, and could go on for hours talking about and brainstorming game ideas. I've expiremented with
                        the Unity game engine for a couple years, and have thoroughly enjoyed every second working with it. Whenever I'm designing things, whether 
                        it be websites or just learning something new about development, you will always find a smile on my face. It will never fail!
